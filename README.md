# Project-1-FARS-Fatal-Crash-Analysis
Multi-year analysis of fatal multi-vehicle and alcohol-involved crashes in the U.S. (2015â€“2023) using FARS data. Includes data engineering, visualization, predictive modeling, and policy simulation. ðŸ“ŠðŸ§ 

The original raw FARS CSV files (2015â€“2023) are too large for GitHub upload limits.
